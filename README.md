<h2>Dynamic Password Generator</h2>

<p>I have created an application that enables a user to generate random passwords based on selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.</p>

The user will have the opportunity to personalize their password by:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Selecting no less than 8 and no more than 128 characters</li>
    <li>Confirming the use of numbers (0-9)</li>
    <li>Confirming the use of special characters (!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~)</li>
    <li>Confirming the use of uppercase and/or lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Demo of Password Generator</h3>

When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button a user input prompt will appear
